# Superplots_R_script
This repository contains an R script to generate Superplots and an Excel file with some data for testing.
SuperPlots were first described by Lord *et. al*. (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03509 and Lord *et. al*., JCB (2020). In my opinion, SuperPlots are one of the most honest ways to represent categorical data. The plot shows all data points with a color-code for each replicate, as well as the averages of each replicate, the total average and the SEM.
